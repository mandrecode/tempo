# Tempo

A native Android app for managing **tasks**, building **habits**, and actually getting the
day started. Tempo combines a flexible task manager (categories, subtasks, priorities,
recurring reminders) with habit tracking built around **habit chains**, and a **Focus** tab
that puts today's work in front of you and runs a timer against it.

> Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, following Clean Architecture + MVI.

## Features

- **Focus** — the tab the app opens on: an agenda of what is due today and what is overdue,
  an "Up next" shortlist you can start a timed session on, a day summary with progress, and
  a streak and history heatmap of the days you showed up.
- **Tasks** — categories, subtasks, priorities, and recurring/periodic reminders with
  rollover handling, plus optional auto-removal of completed tasks.
- **Habits & routines** — habit chains, history visualization, and live-activity style
  reminder notifications.
- **Reminders** — exact-alarm scheduling that survives reboot and time/timezone changes,
  with a daily catch-up sweep for reminders that were missed while the phone was off.
- **Vacation mode** — pause every habit at once, with an optional end date, without
  breaking streaks.
- **Home-screen widget** — quick-add a task without opening the app.
- **Backup & restore** — versioned export/import with conflict reporting and merge modes.
- **Encrypted at rest** — local database (SQLCipher, Android Keystore-protected key) and
  backup exports (user passphrase) are both encrypted.
- **Onboarding & what's new** — a first-run setup flow with notification-permission
  education, and a one-off sheet announcing the latest feature after an update.
- **Adaptive** — one layout across phone, foldable, tablet, desktop and Android XR, with a
  floating navigation bar that becomes a rail on wider windows.
- **Theming** — Material 3 / Material You dynamic color and a configurable theme setting.
- **Localized** — English and Spanish (`values/`, `values-es/`).
