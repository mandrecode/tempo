## Design & implementation notes

- [`design/`](design/) — visual design, typography, colour, and the release visual-consistency
  checklist
- [`implementation/`](implementation/) — notes left behind by past changes (notifications, fonts,
  timezone handling, MVI refactoring, day filtering, Play Store changelog)
- [`performance/startup-audit.md`](performance/startup-audit.md) — cold-start measurements and what
  was done about them

## Where the reasoning lives

Per-change proposals, designs and spec deltas are in
[`openspec/changes/`](../openspec/changes/) — including [`archive/`](../openspec/changes/archive/)
for completed ones. For anything shipped recently, that is the fuller and more current record; the
pages here summarise the parts worth keeping at hand.
