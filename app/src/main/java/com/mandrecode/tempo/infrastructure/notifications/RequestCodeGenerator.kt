/**
 * Generates safe Int request codes from Long IDs for PendingIntents and notification IDs.
 * Uses modulo to prevent Int overflow when Room auto-generated Long IDs exceed Int.MAX_VALUE.
 * Ranges are partitioned by entity type to avoid collisions:
 * - Tasks:                 0 -   999,999
 * - Habits:         1,000,000 - 1,999,999
 * - Chains:         2,000,000 - 2,999,999
 * - Live Activity:  3,000,000 - 3,999,999
 * - Live Activity dismissal: 4,000,000 - 4,999,999
 * - Missed-reminder catch-up: 5,000,000 (single app-wide alarm)
 * - Focus session:  6,000,000 (single app-wide session)
