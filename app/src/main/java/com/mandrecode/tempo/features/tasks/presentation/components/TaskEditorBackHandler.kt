 * moves or clears focus, so a keyboard flicker during a field handoff cannot close the keyboard.

 * changes. A gesture it has started stays its own even if the keyboard closes mid-gesture. Progress
 * is consumed so the sheet does not move, cancellation leaves focus untouched, and completion clears
 * focus once to close the keyboard. Otherwise back falls through to the sheet's guarded dismissal.
