/**
 * Asks before a start ends the session already running.
 *
 * Starting replaces whatever is going and banks only the minutes it earned, so swapping tasks
 * mid-session throws the rest away. That is worth a question rather than something to notice
 * afterwards — and it only appears for a different task, since restarting the same one is just
 * carrying on.
 *
 * On [TempoConfirmDialog], like every other question this app asks, so the title, the buttons and
 * their pressed corners are the ones already met when deleting a task or discarding an edit. Not
 * destructive, though: nothing is deleted here, and painting "Start anyway" in the red kept for
 * deletions would overstate what confirming costs.
